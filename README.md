# EEC 315 / 316 Electronics Laboratory Manual

This repository hosts the **Electronics Laboratory Manual** for:

- **EEC 315 / 316 – Electronics Laboratory**
- Chansu Yu, Ph.D.
- Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  
  Cleveland State University

The manual (December 2021 edition) was developed with support from the **Ohio Space Grant Consortium (OSGC) Curriculum Innovation Proposal (CIP)** and is aligned with **EEC 313 (Electronics I)** and **EEC 314 (Electronics II)**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Course context

The labs are designed to:

- Give each student hands-on experience with **diodes, transistors, and op-amps** using bench instruments and low-cost portable kits (e.g., Analog Discovery 2). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- COVID-19 rendered us to deliver all classes including laboratory courses remotely. We were able to deliver lab experience remotely using AD2 without having to resort to simulations.
- Provide a **single, consistent manual** that includes pre-labs, post-labs, and integrated theory review sessions for students who may not have taken all prerequisite courses. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
